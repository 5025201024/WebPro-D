
**General Overview**
We make our project by using the Laravel Framework to create a website that has CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete) features alongside our own added functionalities. The Website is TCFess. It is an interactive, community based forum similar to Quora, Reddit, Twitter Base. Here we can make accounts and post threads, we can also engage in other users’ threads by replying to their respective threads.

From our assignment, we have analyzed the needs and business model of this website. We are modeling this website after similar community based forums like Quora and Reddit. We implemented this concept using laravel framework. We have CRUD features including but not limited to login, register, and edit accounts. We also made sure that threads and replies are customizable and deletable. This Laravel framework is an MVC based framework where Model / Database, View / UI, and Controller, are separated so we can focus on each module and code more expressively and elegantly. We have evaluated our website and found that although we have fulfilled the needs and business requirements, we are aware that there are areas where we can improve on this website. We can improve on adding more features like sub-thread, newsletter, etc.
